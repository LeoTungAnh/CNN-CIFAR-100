# A simple CNN model in Keras without transfer learning achieves 67% accuracy on test set of CIFAR-100

In this project, I develope some CNN models with various experiment showing benefits of following techniques:
- Increasing number of filters in  convolution layers.
- Increasing number of convolution layers.
- Taking advantages of Dropout layers.
- Taking advantages of Data augmentation.
- Taking advantages of Batch norm layers.

Although I create a very simple model, performance of my model is similar to ResNet50 (#15) in the below link:

# Training time

Training process of model is approximately 3 hours on Google colab with 1 GPU.
